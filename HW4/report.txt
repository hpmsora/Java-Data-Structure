HW4 - Flood-It

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Analysis

In my flood function,

First, looping the each elements in the floodList.
       In this looping for loop, the end of the for
       loop is the size of the floodList.

Second, checking three major checking list for each
	element.
	- Whether the element is in bound of grid.
	- Whether the element is same color number as 
	  received color number
	After checking these two checking list then
	- Whether the element is already in the
	  floodList.

After checking these three things then the element,
coordinate of the element, add to floodList.

Fixed in Driver function
Due to the first cennected colors(elements) are not
recognized initializing the game.
So I forced to initializing the flooList in driver's
construction method.


Time Complexity

 - First, the flood function used n length of the floodList.
 - Due to there is 4 sides to the one elements
   multiplication of 4 is necessary.
 - Then the flood method is checking each of side whether the
   elements in floodList, so that the length of the floodList(n)
   is necesssary.

Therefore the Time Complexity is:

T(n) = 4n^2

From the paper, the brain networks refers presence of nodes, and several
other parameters refered by wight between two nodes. There are some examples,
distance between cneral node or degree or diameter or eccentrity, kappa.
For alpha, beta, theta brain waves, the MST are found for each of parameters.
The MST value of those parameters are comapred between the MST patients and
the normal people. Based on the comparison value, for Theta brainwaves, it is
obvious to see that the diameter, eccentricity, and leaf fraction are the
three parameters that have the major difference between the healthy control
and MS patients. "For Alpha2 brainwaves, diameter, eccentricity, kappa, leaf
fraction, and th are the major parameters that have the major difference
between the healthy control and MS patients. For Beta brainwaves, parameter
Eccentricity is the major difference. "(Source form Internet)

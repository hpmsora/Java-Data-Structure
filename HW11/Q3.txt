From the collection of edges for Dijkstra's algorithm as shortest paths does not
mecessage from spanning, also definition of a spanning tree is subject for
tree to graph so it covered with minimum possible number of edges. So all
the vertices need to be connected somehow. However, Dijkstra’s algorithm
only form the path between two vertices, and not necessary to connect all the
vertices. Therefore, we cannot get a spanning tree from using the Dijkstra’s
algorithm. Also, it’s even more impossible to get a MST.

Answer: 2, 5
	Since the data will be received and inserting to the data set, it does not necessary
	to sorted so that "a linked-list of unsorted record" and "an array-based list of
	unsorted records" are most efficient data. Farther more, the data was already sorted.

2)
Answer: 2, 5
	Since the large number of insertion and only few number of searching, it does not
	necessay to be sorted data.

3)
Answer: 3
	Since there would be equal amount of searching and inserting, a "Binary Search Tree"
	would be the most efficient data. Since both inserting and seaching takes same
	average time which is log(n).

4)
Answer: 1, 4
	Since there would not much insertion and lots of searching, it is obvious that we
	need sorted data which would be "a linked-list maintained in sorted order" and "an
	array-based list maintained in sorted order."
